Blobloom
========

A blocked Bloom filter package for Go (golang) with no runtime dependencies.

[Blocked Bloom filters](https://algo2.iti.kit.edu/documents/cacheefficientbloomfilters-jea.pdf)
are a cache-efficient variant of Bloom filters, the well-known approximate set
data structure. To quote [Daniel Lemire](https://lemire.me/blog/2019/12/19/xor-filters-faster-and-smaller-than-bloom-filters/),
they have unbeatable speed. See the directory ``benchmarks/`` to determine
exactly how fast Blobloom is compared to other packages.

Usage
-----

Construct a Bloom filter:

	f := blobloom.NewOptimized(blobloom.Config{
		Capacity: nkeys, // Expected number of keys.
		FPRate:   1e-4,  // One in 10000 false positives is acceptable.
	})

Add a key:

	// import "github.com/cespare/xxhash/v2"
	h := xxhash.Sum64String(key)
	f.Add(h)

Test for presence of a key:

	h := xxhash.Sum64String(key)
	if f.Has(h) {
		// Key is probably in f.
	} else {
		// Key is certainly not present in f.
	}

See the [package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/greatroar/blobloom)
for further usage information and examples.

Hash functions
--------------

Blobloom does not provide hash functions. Instead, it requires client code to
represent each key as a single 64-bit hash value, leaving it to the user to
pick the right hash function for a particular problem. Here are some general
suggestions:

* If you use Bloom filters to speed up access to a key-value store, you might
want to look at [xxh3](https://github.com/zeebo/xxh3) or [xxhash](
https://github.com/cespare/xxhash).
* If your keys are cryptographic hashes, consider using the first 8 bytes of those hashes.
* If you use Bloom filters to make probabilistic decisions, a randomized hash
function such as [siphash](https://github.com/dchest/siphash) or [maphash](
https://golang.org/pkg/hash/maphash) may prevent the same false positives
occurring every time.

When evaluating a hash function, or designing a custom one, be aware that
Blobloom uses the [fastrange](
https://lemire.me/blog/2016/06/27/a-fast-alternative-to-the-modulo-reduction/)
reduction on the lower 32 bits of the hash to select a block, and
[enhanced double hashing](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/pete/pub/bloom-filters-verification.pdf)
on the upper and lower 32-bit halves, followed by modulo 2<sup>9</sup>,
to derive bit indices.
In particular, this means that casting a 32-bit hash to uint64 causes the
Bloom filter to perform suboptimally.
(These are details of the current implementation, not API guarantees.)
